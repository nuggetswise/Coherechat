# Compensation Planner - AI-Powered Agent Workflow

## Overview
This application is an AI-powered multi-agent system for creating and evaluating compensation packages. It employs a collaborative workflow of specialized AI agents (Recruitment Manager, HR Director, and Hiring Manager) to analyze requirements, ensure policy compliance, and make final compensation decisions with transparent evaluation.

- **Audience:**
  - **Developers:** Learn about the architecture, agent workflow, and tech stack for extending or maintaining the system.
  - **HR Professionals:** Understand how the system works, the agent decision process, and how AI is used to assist compensation planning.

## End-to-End Flow (Non-Technical)

1. **You provide job requirements** (e.g., "Create a compensation package for a Senior Software Engineer in San Francisco") in the input interface.
2. **The Recruitment Manager agent** analyzes your requirements and creates a detailed compensation package based on market data and best practices.
3. **The HR Director agent** reviews the package for policy compliance, internal equity, and alignment with company guidelines.
4. **The Hiring Manager agent** makes the final decision, considering the package details and HR feedback.
5. **The system evaluates each agent's output** for quality, relevance, and accuracy, providing transparent metrics.
6. **You receive a complete compensation package** with detailed analysis and evaluation.

  - Reviews packages for policy compliance and internal equity.
  - Provides a confidence score on the assessment.
  - Suggests changes when necessary.

- **Hiring Manager:**
  - Makes the final decision on the compensation package.
  - Identifies any equity concerns or budget constraints.
  - Provides detailed feedback on the package.

- **Evaluation System:**
  - Evaluates each agent's output based on relevance, factual accuracy, and groundedness.
  - Provides an overall quality score.
  - Identifies strengths and areas for improvement.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo and ensure `data/Compensation Data.csv` is present.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set your Cohere and OpenAI API keys in your environment or Streamlit secrets.
4. Run: `streamlit run pages/Compensation_Planner.py --server.port 8505`
5. Open [http://localhost:8505](http://localhost:8505) in your browser.

---

## Path Resolution
The system uses a robust path resolution mechanism to find the compensation database:
```python
# Get the absolute path to the current file (Compensation_Planner.py)
current_file = os.path.abspath(__file__)
# Get the directory containing the current file (pages/)
current_dir = os.path.dirname(current_file)
# Get the project root directory (one level up from pages/)
project_root = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
# Construct the absolute path to the compensation data file
data_path = os.path.join(project_root, "data", "Compensation Data.csv")
```
This ensures the app works in both local and production environments.

---

## How to Deploy
- Make sure `data/Compensation Data.csv` is included in your deployment.
- Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud or your own server.
- The app will use the internal DB for all agent operations.
- Set the required API keys as environment variables or in Streamlit secrets.

## FAQ
- **Why are all Hiring Manager decisions "Approved"?**
  - The system is designed to always approve packages but provides feedback for improvements.
- **Are evaluation scores hardcoded?**
  - No, all evaluation scores and feedback are generated by the LLM in real time.
- **Can I add more data?**
  - Yes, update `Compensation Data.csv` and restart the app to incorporate new market data.
- **How do I customize agent personalities?**
  - Edit the prompt templates in `comp_planner/persona_prompts.py` to adjust agent behaviors.
- **Can I use a different LLM provider?**
  - Yes, the system is designed to work with both Cohere and OpenAI, and can be extended to other providers.

## üß† System Logic, Agents, and Configuration

### What Happens When You Submit Requirements?
1. **Your requirements are processed by the Recruitment Manager agent** to generate a detailed compensation package.
2. **The HR Director agent reviews the package** for policy compliance and internal equity.
3. **The Hiring Manager agent makes the final decision** based on the package and HR feedback.
4. **Each agent's output is evaluated** for quality, relevance, and accuracy.
5. **You receive a complete compensation package** with transparent evaluation metrics.

### üëî How Agent Workflow Works
- **Recruitment Manager:**
  - Analyzes your requirements to understand the role, level, and location.
  - Creates a comprehensive compensation package with specific values.
  - Extracts structured data like role and level using pattern matching.
- **HR Director:**
  - Reviews the package against company policies and industry standards.
  - Provides a confidence score (1-10) on the assessment.
  - Identifies any policy violations or equity concerns.
- **Hiring Manager:**
  - Reviews both the package and HR feedback.
  - Makes a final decision (always approved, but with feedback).
  - Identifies any risk flags or budget constraints.

### üìä How AI Evaluation Works
- **After each agent completes its task,** the system evaluates the output on:
  - **Relevance:** How well did the output address the requirements?
  - **Factual Accuracy:** Is the information correct and supported?
  - **Groundedness:** Does the output avoid speculation?
- **Each dimension receives a score (1-10) and detailed feedback.**
- **No scores or feedback are hardcoded**‚Äîeverything is generated live for each case.
- **You see a transparent evaluation table with full feedback available.**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è What Can Be Tweaked (Configuration)
- **All agent prompts, evaluation criteria, and workflows are configurable.**
- **You can adjust:**
  - The personality and focus of each agent through prompt engineering
  - The evaluation criteria and scoring weights
  - The detail level of the compensation packages
  - The sources of market data used for reference
- **These settings are typically managed in the persona_prompts.py file.**

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Data Handling
- **Your requirements and generated packages are only used for your session.**
- **The internal compensation database is never exposed directly‚Äîonly processed insights are shown.**
- **All evaluations are performed within the system and not shared externally.**
